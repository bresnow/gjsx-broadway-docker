    # 

 We are not a trading platform. We issue assets that are backed by things you label with nouns.
 Once it's your asset, we have already provided you with a selection of services that add value in it's utility...
 Before it even hit's your wallet. We want to help build a system that separates value from price. Tokenizing your 
 asset does not make it special by default.
